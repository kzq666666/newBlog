#### 自我介绍
<br>上午好，各位导师，我很荣幸能够在这里参加面试。
<br>我叫康志清，今年21岁，出生于江西赣州，本科院校是南昌大学生物工程系，在校期间还选修了计算机科学与技术的双学位。大学期间,四年的学习让我更加知道该如何去学习，怎样去学习，我的学习能力也得到了提高，特别是自学能力，我经常会去图书馆找一些技术的书学习，比如计算机语言、算法之类的书籍。
<br>我是一个乐观向上活泼的人，对于未知的技术充满着好奇，这让我更加有动力去学习。在我业余时间，我喜欢看看动漫，尤其是日本动漫，因此我一直都在学习日语。我经常听歌和游泳来放松自己。我喜欢codeing，和室友一起合作写过几个项目，每个人各自负责相应的板块。
我对计算机专业的相关知识非常感兴趣，特别是web前端方面，但自己的很多知识还有很多欠缺，研究生相对于本科生知识面更广，学术更专业，眼界更广阔，因此想要考研，提高自己的能力和水平。之所以选择暨南大学，一是暨南大学的计算机专业好，二、学术环境和条件好 。希望能够在暨南大学完成自己的学习愿望,在研究生阶段深入学习。
我的介绍到此结束，谢谢。
