### 自我介绍

<br>Good Morning dear professors. Thanks for having me here for this interview.
<br>My name is Kang Zhi Qing. I am 21 years old and I was born in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province. I major in biological engineering at Nanchang University ,  and  I also take a double degree in computer science and technology. 

<br>During my college time, I was taught how to learn, and I was doing great.I got the scholarship and had passed the CET-6 .My learning ability has been improved a lot, especially self-learning. After class I usually go to the library to read some  books, such as Programming language,technical books  and so on.
In the process of learning ,Of course,I often meet with difficults but I am a positive and persistent person and very curious about the unknown technologies，which motives me to solve the problems and keep going. 

<br>In my spare time, I like anime, especially Japanese anime, so I started learning Japanese from last year and also I learned some lauguage about front end like html,javascript.I think I have great interest of lauguage not only the natural  language but also the programing language. when I feel tired,swimming and music are what I usually do to relax.  

<br>I am interested in the computer area, but I think I am still not good enough and need to learn more so this is why I am here.  I decided to continue studying  and improve myself and I really admire the strong academic environment and the beautiful campus in JiNan University. I hope I can get a chance to study here and try my best to have it done. That is it. Thank you.

各位导师，上午好，非常感谢能有这个机会能在这里参加复试。
我叫康志清，今年21岁，出生于江西赣州，我本科学校是南昌大学，专业是生物工程，同时在校期间，我还选修了我们学校的计算机科学与技术的双学位。
<br>大学这四年的学习和生活，让我明白如何去学习，这一点我做的也还可以，在校我拿到过奖学金，通过了英语四六级考试。我的学习能力在这些过程中得到了很多提高，特别是自学能力。课后我会去图书馆找些书看看，比如说编程语言，技术书籍等等。在学习的过程中，当然我也会遇到很多困难，但我是一个比较积极乐观并且坚持不懈的人，这也是让我不断克服这些困难和继续学习下去的原因。
<br>业余时间，我比较喜欢日漫，因此我也学了一年的日语，我觉得自己在学习语言方面还是有一些天赋的，无论是自然语言也好，还是编程语言。我大三时候对web前端方面比较感兴趣，我也自学了前端方面的知识，但我觉得我自己还不够，虽然也在双学位课程中学习了一些基础的知识，但能力方面还有更加的深入的方面都有很多不足，因此我想继续学习下去，这也是我考研的主要原因。我很羡慕暨南大学的学习氛围还有校园的这种环境，因此我希望我能够在暨南大学继续学习下去，我的自我介绍到处结束，谢谢。




### 问题
#### 1.你的家乡 
 I come from Gan Zhou. It is the biggest city in Jiangxi Province in terms of the area of land. It’s in south and bordered to Guangdong province. When people talk about Ganzhou, first thing they mention is Gannan orange. People in Ganzhou are very friendly and the scenery up there is very beautiful because it is surrounded by mountains and rivers. If you ever got a chance, I really recommend you to visit. 

#### 2.你的本科学校
I major in Biological engineering in NanChang university,which is  a comprehensive university filled with acacademic atmosphere.Also,it is a good platform to study and make progress.Through the platform,I have learned how to study and how to improve myself.I really appreciate my school.
#### 3.你的本科学校所在的城市（南昌）
My school is located in NanChang.It is the capital of JiangXi Province.It is in the south and there are many lakes there.When people talk about NanChang,the first thing they mention is NanChang Uprising.The people there are friendly and the scenery here is very beautiful.If you ever got a chance ,I really recommend you to visit.


#### 4.介绍一下你的本科专业（生物工程）
Biological engineering refers to operate the biological species at the cell or individual level through certain technical means, in order to achieve the purpose and needs, to improve the quality of species.

#### 5.介绍一下你的双学位专业（计算机科学与技术）
I love my profession,espically font-end of web direction.I am very satisfied each time to design a program or website in my style.The number zero and one in computer is so beautiful that I am addicted in it.The profession let me know the world in computer and how to coding.I love it.

#### 6.为什么选修计算机双学位（为什么跨考计算机而不是本专业）
在学习生物工程一年之后，我明白这个一个比较注重科学研究，注重实验的学科，我自己感觉自己不太适合做这方面的工作，没有很大的兴趣，而后面偶然机会接触了编程语言，了解了计算机的世界，发现自己对这方面感兴趣，自己慢慢开始喜欢这个学科，它给我带来的成就感很多，有时写出一个程序或者一个算法甚至会开心一整天，因此就转专业了。
After studying biological engineering for a year, I understand that this subject need to pay more attention to scientific research and experimentation, I feel that I am not suitable for this work, and I don't have much interest, and one summer vocation I came across a programming language. I learned about the computer world and found that I was interested in this area. I slowly started to like this subject. It brought me a lot of sense of accomplishment. Sometimes I  finish a program or an algorithm and I will be happy even the all day, so I take my double degree of CS/ I take the CS of postgraduate entrance examination.
#### 7.为什么考研
I am very interested in computer related knowledge, especially in the front-end of web, however I still have a lot of knowleage to learn. Compared with undergraduates, postgraduates have  wider knowledge, more professional academic, broader eyes,  Therefore, I want to take the postgraduate entrance examination to improve my ability and level

#### 8.为什么选择暨南大学
之所以选择暨南大学，一是暨南大学的计算机专业好，二、学术环境和条件好 
First Jinan University's computer major  is good,and I really admire the strong academic environment and conditions.In my eyes,as one of the most famous university in guangdong province,it will be a good platform for me to study and improve myself.So I choose jinan University.

#### 9.评价一下你的性格
I am an optimistic and positive person.When I meet some difficulties,I choose to find ways to solve it ranther than giving up. And my learning ability is great.I can learn or accept a new thing quickly.Besides,I am also a persistent boy.I will try my best to deal with the porblem and difficulies.

#### 10.英语的重要性
I think English is very important at all times.I have learning English for many years.English,as the most common language in the world,plays a significant part in my daily life.Many documents about a new technology are in English.I am supposed to learn it well to understand the meaning of the docs.So do the books and journals.
